### ESP32 SSD1306 MPU6050 Sand Grains

This little repo was made just for a day fun, it's definitely not good "learn how to" code, Adafruit has better examples, I'm sure.
I wanted to play a bit with OLED display and make some algo to simulate animated grains of sand.
But never found the right code for *this type of display and accelerometer* so created and published my own.

## How does it look like?
